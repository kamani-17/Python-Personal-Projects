First (really second personal project to improve my python skills)
Here I did a chess game - this was the result of 3 crash outs and not realising I had made some errors and AI (apart from Cursor) was overlooking them. 
Nevertheless it was a fun project to do and see come to life and better yet test & work.

In this readme I also wish to share my learnings and understanding throughout the process too.
